# TankVsMeteors
A simple 3D game made with Defold about a tank surviving a meteor apocalypse.

The project is oversimplified for 3D rendering - no GUI, no sprites, a single material.

It supports both orthographic projection (top-down view) and perspective projection (behind the tank view).

If you want to understand how the game works, just look in the source code, there are explaining comments.
